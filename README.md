#Speculum Maius
###The Great Mirror

The Great Mirror is a Ruby on Rails project modeled after some of the highly trafficked link-aggregating websites (reddit, hackernews, etc) that exist today.

Trolls? Meme Magic? The Encyclopedia Meme-atica? The magical great mirror dreamed up by monks and friars in the middle ages has become a reality, encompassing the collective knowledge of the world, traversing space and time, and filled with treasures and monsters both real and imaginary.

The Great Mirror is a place for sharing images that emerge from late night wanderings on the web.  Any user can view posts and browse the content. If a user chooses to signup and login, they can then submit their own content. Those same authorized users can then vote on posts which bubble up to the top based on the overall community up-vote ranking.

#Technologies Used:

Ruby on Rails | Postgresql Database | Active Record | Javascript | JQuery | Bootstrap | Font-Awesome | HTML5 | CSS3 | Git | Github | Heroku 

This was my first project using Ruby and its framework Rails.
It was also my first encounter with more in depth MVC framework, restful routing, user authentication, production deployment using Heroku and maintaining a persistent database.

It took some time and head scratching to understand the real power of "convention over configuration" that is essential to the RoR framework. I wanted to avoid too much of that rails magic by simply generating scaffolding. This allowed me plenty of opportunities to test the framework, while navigating all sorts of errors and to improve my debugging skills 

While using sites likes Reddit or Hackernews as a rough blueprint I knew that I needed to autheticate & authorize users and maintain a proper application layout as described in the Ruby Style Guide such as creating restful routes, formatting templates and layouts to be DRY, and proper namespacing.
