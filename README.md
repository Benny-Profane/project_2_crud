#Speculum Maius
###The Great Mirror

The Great Mirror is a Ruby on Rails project modeled after some of the highly trafficked link-aggregating or link sharing websites (reddit, hackernews, etc) that exist today.

Any user can view posts and browse the content. If a user chooses to signup and login, they can then submit their own content. Those same authorized users can then vote on posts which bubble up to the top based on the overall community up-vote ranking.

#Inspiration
Trolls? Meme Magic? The Encyclopedia Meme-atica? The magical great mirror dreamed up by monks and friars in the middle ages has become a reality, encompassing the collective knowledge of the world, traversing space and time, and filled with treasures and monsters, both real and imaginary. 

At some point everyone has lost themselves ten links deep into wikipedia and if you're like me, there is an almost mystical state of awe at the sheer expansiveness and interconnectedness  LESSIG.... Somehow the prodigious growth of the internet creates its own need for late-night explorers. The Great Mirror is a place for sharing the strange, sundry and otherwise unnoticed images form the palimpset of the internet.

#Technologies Used:

This was my first intoduction to the programming language Ruby and its framework Rails.
It was also my first encounter with an MVC framework, restful routing, user authentication, production deployment using Heroku and maintaining a persistent database.

It took me some time to understand the real power of "convention over configuration" that is essential to the RoR framework. The "rails magic" of having entire file structures and web applications built with just one command line in the terminal is still somewhat magical to me, but I wanted to avoid too much of that rails magic by simply generating scaffolding. This allowed me to really see how Rails works "under the hood".


While using sites likes Reddit or Hackernews as a rough blueprint I initially knew I needed to:

Autheticate Users using devise?
After authentication & authorization users can post URLS
Restful routes
User form data to display
Styling

Git | Github | Heroku 
Ruby on Rails | Postgresql Database | Active Record
Javascript | JQuery
Bootstrap | Font-Awesome 
HTML5 | CSS3
