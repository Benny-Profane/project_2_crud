###The Great Mirror

The Great Mirror is a Ruby on Rails project modeled after some of the highly trafficked link-aggregating or link sharing websites (reddit, hackernews, etc) that exist today.

Initially users can view posts and browse the content. Once users login they can submit their own content. Individual users can vote on posts which then bubble up to the top. 

Trolls? Meme Magic? The Encyclopedia Meme-atica? The magical great mirror dreamed up by monks and friars in the middle ages has become a reality, encompassing the collective knowledge of the world, traversing space and time, and filled with treasures and monsters, both real and imaginary.
