###The Great Mirror

The Great Mirror is a RoR project modeled after some of the highly trafficked link-aggregating or link sharing websites (reddit, hackernews, etc) that exist today.

Initially users can view posts and browse the content. Once users login they can submit their own content. Individual users can vote on posts which then bubble up to the top.
